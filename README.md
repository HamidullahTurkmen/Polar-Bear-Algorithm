# Polar-Bear-Optimization-Algorithm
In this probe, I solved math problem by using a nature-inspired optimization algorithm, which we called Polar Bear Optimization Algorithm (PBO). The inspiration to develop the algorithm comes from the way polar bears hunt to survive in harsh arctic conditions. for more information about the algorithm :  https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/203
